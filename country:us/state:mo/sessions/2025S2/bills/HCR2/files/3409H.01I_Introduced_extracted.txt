2 Constitutionguaranteesthatthegovernmentcannot"denytoanypersonwithinitsjurisdiction
3 the equal protection of the laws"; and
4
5 WHEREAS, in the context of voting rights and elections, this has often been
6 interpreted to mean "one person, one vote"; and
7
8 WHEREAS, the state of Missouri cannot stand by as the President of the United
9 States and legislators in other states manipulate elections in the middle of the decade in order
10 to sway the outcome of federal elections and control the U.S. House of Representatives; and
11
12 WHEREAS, leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives impacts the life,
13 wellbeing, and prosperity of all Americans, and the election manipulation being undertaken
14 impacts not only citizens in those states but every citizen across the country; and
15
16 WHEREAS, it is incumbent on all states, which have the ability to do so, to counter
17 this election manipulation; and
18
19 WHEREAS, eleven states, including both red and blue states, have adopted
20 commissions to take away primary responsibility from their state legislatures for drawing
21 maps for congressional districts, as state legislatures have historically drawn partisan maps
22 that favor one political party and diluted the power of voters; and
23
24 WHEREAS, states with redistricting commissions have taken critical steps towards
25 ensuring fair representation, and states that have not followed suit continue to have overt
HCR 2 2
26 political influence in the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives elections and the
27 balance of political power in the U.S. House of Representatives; and
28
29 WHEREAS, because of this, it is impossible to have fairness in representation until
30 all states are held to the same standards:
31
32 NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the members of the House of
33 Representatives of the One Hundred Third General Assembly, Second Extraordinary Session
34 of the First Regular Session, the Senate concurring therein, hereby declare that the state of
35 Missouri upholds that all Americans have a right to fair and equal representation; and
36
37 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the state of Missouri upholds that
38 Congressional intervention is necessary for fair and equal representation for all Americans;
39 and
40
41 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED in response to the mid-decade redistricting of
42 certain states in an effort to expressly sway control of the U.S. House of Representatives
43 following the 2026 midterm elections, Missouri asserts that all states that have the power to,
44 shouldconductamid-decaderedistrictingin2025,orearliestyearlegallypossible,inorderto
45 ensure that the outcome of the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives for the
46 120th Congress and subsequent congresses cannot be unduly swayed by the partisan or racial
47 gerrymandering of one or more states acting in bad faith; and
48
49 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED the state of Missouri calls on Congress to act
50 expeditiously and before the redistricting cycle following the 2030 decennial census is
51 undertakenandpassfederalredistrictingstandardswithquantitativemeasuresforfairnessand
52 representation; and
53
54 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED in order to be most effective, the quantitative
55 measures for fairness should ensure that the statewide proportion of districts in each
56 redistricting plan correspond as closely as possible to the statewide partisan preference of
57 voters to help prevent voter power from being diluted; and
58
59 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED Congress must put in place protections to ensure
60 communities of interest, including communities of color, are not divided in ways that dilute
61 their political power; and
62
HCR 2 3
63 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED only Congressional action for fair redistricting
64 standards will ensure that a redistricting arms race cannot occur again, and only quantitative
65 measures will ensure that the people and the courts can truly hold states accountable; and
66
67 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED in the event that Congress enacts federal
68 redistricting standards with quantitative measures for fairness prior to the beginning of the
69 redistricting cycle following the 2030 decennial census, the state of Missouri shall abide by
70 those fair standards in accordance with federal and state law; and
71
72 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED in the absence of Congressional action prior to the
73 2030 decennial census, it is likely that states which worked to gerrymander at the behest of
74 the President will continue to draw similarly partisan and racially gerrymandered maps that
75 dilute the political power of the American people. In order to ensure that all states are able to
76 fight fair and have their say in the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives, the
77 stateofMissouricalls onallstateswithredistrictingcommissionstobypasstheirredistricting
78 commissions for the drawing of congressional maps until Congress passes federal
79 redistricting standards. Only this will ensure that the thirty-nine states without
80 redistricting commissions do not have an outsized influence on the balance of power in the
81 U.S. House of Representatives; and
82
83 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of
84 Representatives be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed copy of this resolution for the

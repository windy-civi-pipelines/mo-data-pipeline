consent calendar at any time the Senate goes to the order of
business of committee reports. When a bill is placed upon

starting with the first day the bill appears on the consent
calendar in the Journal any member or the Committee on
Rules, Joint Rules, Resolutions, and Ethics may, by filing
written objection with the Secretary of the Senate, direct
that it be returned to the senate committee from which it
was reported for action in accordance with the rules of the
senate. A bill placed upon the senate consent calendar
shall not be subject to amendment, except for committee
amendments, and after the committee amendments have been
disposed of shall be third read as though it had previously
been perfected. If returned to committee, the chairman may
report the bill to the senate at the next time that order of
business is taken up, without further action of the
20

committee. No senate bill may be placed on the consent
calendar after March fifteenth and no house bill shall be
placed on the consent calendar after April fifteenth.

the amendment or reenactment of an existing statutory or
constitutional provision with changes in the language
thereof, in setting forth the provision as amended or
changed, shall upon introduction, after perfection, and upon
final passage have the matter which is to be omitted
included in its proper place enclosed in brackets and all
new matter to be inserted shall be underscored when
typewritten for introduction. When printed the amendatory
or reenacting bill or joint resolution shall show the matter
to be omitted enclosed in bold-faced brackets and the new
matter shall be shown in bold-faced Roman type. A footnote
shall be annexed to the first page of each bill which
contains material enclosed in bold-faced brackets to the
following effect:
"Explanation--Matter enclosed in bold-faced brackets in
the above bill is not enacted and is intended to be omitted
from the law."
When a section is completely rewritten, the existing
section shall be set forth in bold-faced brackets in a note
following the new section, but the changes need not be
distinguished. When any section is to be repealed and no
reenactment of the material therein is proposed, the section
shall be set forth in the bill in bold-faced brackets.
Statutory section numbers of any senate bill or joint
resolution or any substitute for a house bill shall be
presented, as nearly as practicable, sequentially throughout
the body of the bill followed by any undesignated sections.
Any bill or joint resolution or substitute therefor which
21

does not comply with this rule shall not be placed upon the
calendar of the senate.
Rule 47. Each bill or joint resolution shall, before
being finally acted upon by any committee, be submitted to
the committee on legislative research for preparation of a
fiscal note examining the cost of the proposed legislation
to the state for the first two years that public funds will
be used to fully implement the provisions of the Act,
whether or not the proposed legislation will establish a
program or agency that will duplicate an existing program or
agency, whether or not there is a federal mandate for the
program or agency, whether or not the proposed program or
agency will have significant direct fiscal impact upon any
political subdivision of the state, or whether or not any
new physical facilities will be required.
The fiscal note for a bill shall accompany the bill
throughout its course of passage, and may from time to time
be revised to reflect changes made in the bill prior to its
presentation to the governor for his approval.
Rule 48. No bills, other than appropriation bills,
shall be introduced in the senate after March first of any
regular session unless consented to by a majority of the
elected members of the senate, and no bills other than
appropriation bills shall be introduced in the senate after
the sixtieth legislative day of any regular session, unless
consented to by a majority of the elected members of the
house and senate, or the governor requests consideration of
the proposed legislation by a special message.
(Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 25.)
Rule 49. Up to one thousand copies of all bills and
joint resolutions shall be printed after their first reading
and before a second reading is permitted, unless otherwise
ordered. Bills and resolutions for the senate shall be
22

printed in pamphlet form, as for the last and previous
sessions, in page size eight and one-half by eleven inches.
A copy of the printed bill shall be attached to the original
bill when it is referred to committee, and thereafter the
original and the printed copy thereof shall be kept
together. The bill shall not be re-typed, but upon
perfection a printed copy of the bill with all amendments or
substitutes adopted incorporated shall be attached to the
original bill. Upon final passage by the senate, the
original, with a printed copy of the bill as perfected
attached thereto, shall be transmitted to the house. Upon
final passage by both houses the bill shall be printed as
truly agreed and finally passed, shall be signed by the
presiding officers in printed form, and shall be presented
to the governor in printed form with appropriate spaces for
signatures, and such printed bill, appropriately signed,
shall constitute the original roll for the bill.
Rule 50. Referrals of bills and appointments to
committee shall be made by the president pro tem; and no
bill shall be considered for final passage unless it has
been reported on by a committee and printed for the use of
the senators. A report of all bills recommended "do pass"
by a committee shall be submitted to the senate by the
chairman and all committee amendments accompanying the
report shall be printed in the Journal.
After a bill has been referred to a committee, one-
third of the senators elected has the power to relieve a
committee of further consideration of a bill and place it on
the calendar for consideration. In any case where a
committee has been relieved of further consideration of a
bill as herein provided, a majority of the senators present
but not less than one-third of the senators elected, may, at
any time before final passage thereof, again refer the bill
23

to the same or some other committee for consideration. No
bill or resolution shall be reported adversely by any
committee until the author of the bill or resolution has
been given an opportunity to appear and be heard before the
committee to which it is referred.
One-third of the senators elected may relieve a
committee of an appointment and a motion to grant advice and
consent of the Senate to that appointment is then in order
upon a vote of the majority of the Senate.
Rule 51. A majority of the members of a committee
constitutes a quorum. No committee shall take final action
on a bill unless a quorum is present. Each committee shall
keep a record of the members present when a bill is finally
considered; and this record and the record of the votes cast
shall be filed by the committee with its report.
(Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 22.) No bill shall be reported
from a committee unless such action is approved by
affirmative vote by a majority of those present. Votes of
"present" and abstentions from voting shall not be counted
in the affirmative or negative. Executive sessions may be
used only for purposes of discussion.
Rule 52. Senate bills reported to the senate from any
committee shall lie on the table one day before being
perfected and ordered printed. Senate bills reported
perfected and house bills reported from committee shall lie
over one day before being third read.
Rule 53. Senate bills reported adversely from standing
committees shall not be placed on the calendar, but on
motion made within two legislative days after the report is
filed, the author of the bill being present, it may be
placed on the calendar by a vote of the majority of senators
elected. If no such vote is taken within that time, the
bill shall lie on the table. House bills reported adversely
24

from the standing committees shall not be placed on the
calendar, but on motion made within two legislative days
after the report is filed may be placed on the calendar by a
majority vote of the senators elected. If no such vote is
taken within that time, the bill shall lie on the table.
Rule 54. No law shall be passed except by bill, and no
bill shall be so amended in its passage through the senate
as to change its original purpose. (Constitution, Art. III,
Sec. 21.)
Rule 55. Every bill shall be read by title on three
different days. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 21.)
Rule 56. Bills, whether they originate in the senate
or in the house, may be amended or rejected. (Constitution,
Art. III, Sec. 21.)
Rule 57. No bill shall contain more than one subject
which shall be clearly expressed in its title, except bills
enacted under the third exception in Section 37 of Article
III of the Constitution, and general appropriation bills,
which may embrace the various subjects and accounts for
which moneys are appropriated. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec.
23.)
Rule 58. No act shall be revived or reenacted unless
it shall be set forth at length as if it were an original
act. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 23.)
Rule 59. On all bills containing an emergency clause,
the vote shall be taken on the bill, excluding the emergency
clause, and if the bill receives the vote of a majority of
all the senators elected then the vote shall be taken on the
emergency clause without debate, and if two-thirds of the
senators elected vote in favor of it, the bill takes effect
at the time described in the preamble of the emergency
clause thereof. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 29.)
25

Rule 60. An amendment shall not go beyond the second
degree to an original bill. All amendments adopted by
either house to a bill pending and originating in the same
shall be incorporated in the bill, and the bill as perfected
shall before the third reading and final passage, be printed
for the use of the members. The printing of bills ordered to
third reading and final passage shall be under the
supervision of the Committee on Rules, Joint Rules,
Resolutions and Ethics, whose report shall set forth that
they find the printed copy of such bills as theretofore
agreed and furnished for the use of the members is correct.
A correct record of each day's proceedings in each house
shall be furnished for the use of the members of the general
assembly before the record is approved and no bill shall be
signed by the presiding officer of either house until such
printed copy thereof shall have been furnished for the use
of the members of the general assembly and the record of the
previous day shall have been approved. When agreed to by
both houses, the bill as finally passed shall be typed or
printed and signed by the presiding officer of each house
and transmitted to the governor.
Rule 61. If a bill passed by the senate is returned
thereto, amended by the house, the senate shall cause the
amendment or amendments received to be printed and copies
distributed among the members before final action on such
amendments. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 24.)
Rule 62. No amendment to bills by the house shall be
concurred in by the senate except by a vote of the majority
of the senators elected taken by yeas and nays, and the
names of those voting for and against recorded upon the
Journal, and if amendments are concurred in by the senate,
the bill, as amended, shall be submitted to the vote of the
senate by yea and nay vote, and the names of those voting
26

for or against recorded on the Journal; and reports of
committees of conference shall be adopted in the senate only
by a vote of a majority of the senators elected thereto,
taken by yeas and nays, and the names of those voting
recorded on the Journal. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 27.)
If a bill passed by the Senate is returned thereto, amended
by the House in the form of a substitute with adopted
amendments, it shall be considered as a whole without the
amendments being subject to consideration individually. The
same shall apply to House bills returning to the Senate
which have been passed by the Senate in the form of
Substitutes with adopted amendments.
Rule 63. No act shall be amended by providing that
designated words be stricken out, or that designated words
be inserted, or that designated words be stricken out and
others inserted in lieu thereof, but the words to be
stricken out, or the words to be inserted, or the words to
be stricken out and those inserted in lieu thereof, together
with the act or section amended, shall be set forth in full
as amended. (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 28.)
Rule 64. A substitute for the text of a bill is not in
order until all pending amendments thereto have been
disposed of. A substitute bill for an original bill or for
a committee substitute shall take the form of an original
bill and be subject to floor amendments, except that it
shall not be subject to amendment by a further floor
substitute. No further amendments or substitutes may be
entertained after the senate adopts a substitute bill.
Rule 65. The withdrawal of a pending motion by its
maker or a motion to place a bill on the informal calendar,
along with any pending amendments or substitutes, by its
sponsor is a privilege that may be exercised at any time,
even while another member is addressing the senate or if an
27

amendment or substitute is pending. When the senate returns
to the bill, the sponsor of the pending amendment or
substitute shall be first recognized by the chair on the
pending amendment or substitute.
Rule 66. 1. To effect the passage of a bill on the
final reading thereof, the vote shall be taken by yeas and
nays, and the names of the senators voting for and against
the same shall be entered and recorded in the Journal, and
if a majority of the senators elected vote in favor thereof,
the bill shall be declared passed. No senator shall be
allowed to cast or change his or her vote after the senate's
action on said question is announced by the president.
2. Any member may offer an amendment or amendments for
the portion of a joint resolution or bill to be submitted to
the voters by the General Assembly that contains the
proposed official summary statement and fiscal note
summary. Such amendment may be further amended as provided
by the rules of the Senate.
Rule 67. When a bill is put upon its final passage
and, failing to pass, a motion is made to reconsider the
vote by which it was defeated, the presiding officer shall
briefly state the nature of the bill. Thereupon the vote on
the motion to reconsider shall be immediately taken, without
interrogation or debate, and the subject finally disposed of
without interrogation or debate before the senate proceeds
to any other business.
Rule 68. No bill shall become a law until after it has
been signed by the presiding officer of the senate, in open
session. Before the presiding officer affixes his or her
signature to any bill he or she shall suspend all other
business, declare that the bill will now be read, and that
if no objection be made he or she will sign it to the end
that it may become a law. The bill shall then be read and
28

if no objection is made, he or she shall, in the presence of
the senate, in open session, and before any other business
is entertained affix his or her signature, which fact shall
be noted in the Journal, and the bill immediately sent to
the other house. If any senator objects that any
substitution, omission or insertion has occurred, so that
the bill proposed to be signed is not the same in substance
and form as when considered and passed by the senate or
house, or that any particular clause of Article III of the
Constitution has been violated in its passage, such
objection shall be passed upon by the senate, and if
sustained, the presiding officer shall withhold his or her
signature; but if the objection is not sustained, then any
five members may embody it over their signature, in a
written protest, under oath, against the signing of the
bill. The protest, when offered in the senate, shall be
noted upon the Journal, and the original shall be annexed to
the bill, to be considered by the governor in connection
therewith; and if the bill is one that has not been first
signed by the presiding officer of the house, it shall
immediately be sent to the house after it has been so read
and signed in the senate, for such action thereon in the
house as is prescribed by the constitution. (Constitution,
Art. III, Sec. 30.)
Rule 69. When any bill passed by both houses has been
signed as provided for in the preceding rule, it is the duty
of the secretary of the senate, if the bill originated in
the senate, to present it in person, on the same day on
which it was signed, as aforesaid, to the governor, take his
or her receipt therefor and enter the fact of such delivery
and the time thereof upon the Journal. Every bill presented
to the governor and returned within fifteen days to the
house in which it originated, with the approval of the
29

governor shall become a law unless it is in violation of
some provision of the constitution.
Rule 70. Bills vetoed by the governor and returned to
the senate by the governor or by the house shall stand as
reconsidered and such action shall be taken thereon as
prescribed by the constitution and by the Joint Rules of the
Senate and House of Representatives. (Constitution, Art.
III, Sec. 32.)
Rule 71. All resolutions proposing amendments to the
constitution shall be treated, in all respects, in the
introduction and form of proceedings on them in the senate,
in the same manner as bills. All other orders and
resolutions (except courtesy resolutions) shall be referred
to a committee unless the senate otherwise expressly allows
by a majority vote of senators elected. Courtesy
resolutions will be read only upon request of the senator
offering the resolution. Courtesy resolutions shall be
printed in the Journal only upon the request of the senator
offering the resolution. A senator who wishes to offer a
courtesy resolution which is not to be read or printed may
file the resolution with the secretary of senate who will
show the resolution in the Journal as having been adopted by
the senate.
Rule 72. A motion to adjourn and a motion to fix the
day to which the senate shall adjourn is in order, unless a
senator is speaking, or the yeas and nays are being taken,
or a call is being made, and shall be decided without
debate; and no senator shall leave his or her seat until the
result is declared.
Rule 73. When a question is under debate, no motion
shall be received but to adjourn, to lay on the table, for
the previous question, to postpone to a day certain, to
commit or amend, to postpone indefinitely, which several
30

motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are
arranged. Pending the motion to lay on the table, the
merits of the question shall not be discussed, and no motion
to postpone to a certain day, to commit or postpone
indefinitely, being decided, shall again be allowed on the
same day, at the same stage of the bill or proposition.
Rule 74. When a question is postponed indefinitely it
shall not be acted on during the session.
Rule 75. When a question is laid on the table, it may
not thereafter be considered except by vote of two-thirds of
the senators elected, except that all measures, other than
bills which stand as reconsidered having been returned by
the governor with his or her objections, not finally acted
upon on adjournment of the senate in odd-numbered years
shall lie on the table and the subject matter of such
measures may be taken from the table only by reintroduction
of a measure at a subsequent session of the senate.
Rule 76. When a senator is about to speak, he or she
should rise respectfully and address himself or herself to
the chair, standing at his or her seat, and wait until his
or her name or designation is announced, when he or she
shall proceed, addressing himself or herself always to the
chair. If a senator is unable to stand due to a permanent
physical disability, he or she, after seeking recognition
from the chair, shall be recognized in lieu of standing. If
a senator is unable to stand due to a temporary physical
disability, he or she shall send a letter to the secretary
of the senate, which shall be printed in the journal and
subsequently shall be recognized from the chair in lieu of
standing. In order to maintain the recognition of the
chair, the senator must be engaged in debate or in
discourse. When a senator is engaged in debate or discussion
31

and seeks to have the senate stand at ease, the senator must
seek unanimous consent of the body.
Rule 77. If two or more senators seek recognition in
accordance with Rule 76 at once, the chair shall name the
senator who is to speak first, the other seeking recognition
having the preference next to speak. However, nothing in
this rule shall be interpreted to prevent any senator not
chosen to speak first from immediately making any motion
that is in order under the rules.
Rule 78. The chair shall preserve decorum, and if any
senator transgresses the rules of the senate, the chair
shall, or any senator may, call him or her to order, in
which case the senator called to order shall immediately sit
down, unless permitted to explain; and the senate, if
appealed to, shall decide on the case. If there is no
appeal, the decision of the chair shall prevail. If the
decision of the chair is in favor of the senator called to
order, he or she shall be at liberty to proceed.
Rule 79. If a senator is called to order for words
spoken in debate, the senator calling him or her to order
shall repeat the words excepted to, and they shall be taken
down in writing on the secretary's table, and no senator
shall be held to answer, or be subject to the censure of the
senate for words spoken in debate, if any other senator has
spoken or business has intervened after the words spoken and
before exception to them has been taken.
Rule 80. No senator shall speak more than once on the
same question without leave of the senate, unless he or she
is the mover, proposer or introducer of the matter pending,
in which case he or she shall be permitted to speak or
reply, but not until every senator choosing to speak has
spoken. After a senator has been recognized to close, no
other senator is permitted to speak on the pending matter,
32

except that in the case of a proposed amendment to a bill or
resolution, the proponent of the amendment and the author of
the bill or resolution to be amended may be interrogated,
but, in the case of a bill or resolution, only the author of
the bill or resolution may be interrogated. If a senator
refuses to exercise his or her right to close, the motion
and subject matter of said motion before the body are deemed
to be withdrawn.
Rule 81. In proceedings and debate of the senate, the
senators shall not be spoken of or addressed by their
individual names.
Rule 82. If the question in debate contains several
points, any senator may have it divided if it comprehends
propositions in substance so distinct that by one being
taken away a substantive proposition remains for the
decision of the senate. On motion to strike out and insert,
it shall not be in order to move for a division of the
question, but a rejection of the motion to strike out and
insert a different proposition shall not prevent a
subsequent motion simply to strike out, nor shall the
rejection of a motion simply to strike out prevent a
subsequent motion to strike out and insert. If the question
in debate is a bill or a substitute thereof, a request to
divide the bill or substitute shall not be in order.
Rule 83. On the discussion of any business which may,
in the opinion of a senator require secrecy, the president
shall order the gallery to be cleared, and during the
discussion the doors shall remain closed unless otherwise
directed by the senate. When nominations are made in
writing by the governor of the state to the senate for
confirmation, the confirmation shall, without debate, be
sent to the senate for confirmation, the confirmation shall,
without debate, be referred to the appropriate committee for
33

investigation, and their report shall be made to the senate
as soon as practicable.
Rule 84. The previous question shall be in this form:
"Shall the main question be now put?". It shall only be
admitted on written demand of ten senators, and sustained by
a vote of a majority of the senators elected, and in effect
shall be put without debate, and bring the senate to direct
vote upon a motion to commit, if such motion shall have been
made; and if this motion does not prevail, then upon
amendments, and then upon the main question. On demand for
the previous question, a call of the senate shall be in
order, but after a majority of the senators elected have
sustained such a motion, no call shall be in order prior to
the decision on the main question.
Rule 85. On motion of the previous question, no debate
shall be allowed and all incidental questions of order
arising after the motion is made for the previous question,
and pending such motion, shall be decided on appeal or
otherwise without debate; if, on a vote for the previous
question, the motion is not sustained by a majority of the
senators elected, then the further consideration of the
subject matter shall be in order.
Rule 86. Every motion, except motion to recess or
adjourn, shall be reduced to writing if two or more senators
request it.
Rule 87. When a motion is made it shall be stated by
the chair, or being in writing, it shall be handed to and
read aloud by the secretary before debate.
Rule 88. After a motion is stated by the chair, it is
deemed to be in possession of the senate, but may be
withdrawn at any time by the sponsor or handler before a
vote on said motion.
34

Rule 89. All questions, whether in committee or
senate, shall be first stated in the order in which they are
moved, but voted upon in reverse order, except privileged
questions, which shall be propounded as stated in Rule 73;
and in filling up blanks, the largest sum and longest time
shall be put first.
Rule 90. The yeas and nays shall not be ordered on any
question after a vote has been taken thereon and declared by
the chair.
Rule 91. Every senator who is within the bar of the
senate when a question is put shall assume his or her seat,
and shall vote when his or her name is called unless the
senator, for special reasons, excuses himself or herself
from voting. A senator shall seek to excuse himself or
herself from voting before the senate divides, or before
the call for yeas and nays is commenced. In taking the yeas
and nays, each senator shall declare distinctly his or her
vote yea or nay. In the event a senator within the chamber
refuses to cast his or her vote, then, at the direction of
the president, he or she shall be removed from the chamber
and such action noted in the Journal.
Rule 92. When a question has once been decided by a
vote of the senate, any senator voting on that side which
prevails may move for a reconsideration of the vote at any
time within three legislative days, excluding legislative
days wherein the roll is not called, after the day on which
the vote was had, except votes ordering bills printed as
perfected, which may be reconsidered at any time before
third reading of such bills. When a motion is made to
reconsider the vote by which a bill failed of perfection,
the presiding officer shall briefly state the nature of the
bill and, thereupon, the vote on the motion to reconsider
shall be immediately taken without interrogation or debate.
35

All motions to reconsider shall be decided by a majority
vote of the senators elected. Only one motion to reconsider
shall be allowed on any question.
Rule 93. Any senator voting in the minority on any
subject, and protesting against the vote of the senate, may
have his or her protest entered on the Journal, if the tenor
and language of the protest would have been admissible in
the discussion of the subject.
Rule 94. No person except members of the house of
representatives, former members of the senate, the
governor, the secretary of state, the state auditor, the
state treasurer, judges of the supreme court, courts of
appeals or circuit courts, attorney general and the
congress, shall be admitted within the senate chamber during
the sitting of the senate, unless invited by the senate;
except that the seats at the north and south ends of the
senate chamber may be reserved for spouses and families of
members of the senate, and other persons may be admitted to
the senate chamber on special request of any senator when
the senate is in session. Access to the third floor rear
gallery shall be limited to senators during the hours in
which the senate is engaged in floor session. Any use of
the gallery when the senate is not in session must be
approved by the Chairman of the Committee on Administration.
Rule 95. No senator shall absent himself or herself
from the session of the senate unless he or she has leave or
is sick or unable to attend. A member who is absent from
the chamber for attendance at a standing committee meeting,
or a conference committee meeting shall be shown as absent
with leave (committee). It shall be the responsibility of
the member to advise the secretary of the senate of his or
her attendance at such committee meeting.
36

Rule 96. 1. Laptop computers may be used by Senators,
Senators' staff and senate staff at the staff table, by the
Secretary of the Senate at the dais, and by the research
staff at the research table in the Senate Chamber as long as
their use does not violate Rule 78 or is otherwise
disruptive to the business of the Senate. An electronic
device approved by the Committee on Administration and
provided by the Senate that is capable of monitoring
legislation may be used by a Senator in the chamber. Any
such approved electronic device shall not be a laptop
computer. No person shall take any photograph in the Senate
Gallery. Persons with cameras, flash cameras, lights, or
other paraphernalia may be allowed to use such devices at
committee meetings with the permission of the Chairman as
long as they do not prove disruptive to the decorum of the
committee. Smoking is not permissible in the Senate Chamber
or Gallery, the Kirchoff Gallery, the Pershing Gallery, the
Bingham Gallery, committee rooms, lounge, the hallways,
restrooms or elevators.
2. For the purpose of compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the President Pro Tem may designate a
portion of the Senate Chamber as handicap accessible and
such areas shall not be considered a part of the floor of
the Senate for the purposes of section 21.420, RSMo.
Persons using such area shall not lobby members of the
Senate while going to and from or while using the designated
area.
Rule 97. In cases not provided for in these rules, the
senate shall be governed by the rules laid down in the
practice and procedures adopted by the Senate of the United
States and Jefferson's Manual, including the U.S. Senate
practice that a substitute amendment to a first degree
amendment is subject to a second degree perfecting amendment.
37

Rule 98. No standing rule or order of the senate shall
be rescinded or changed without one day's notice being given
of the motion thereof, which notice shall be printed in the
journal of the senate, and then only by a vote of at least a
majority of the senators elected; except that any rule,
including this rule, may be suspended for a special purpose,
stated in the motion to suspend, by a vote of a two-thirds
majority of the members elected to the senate, and such rule
shall remain suspended only until the senate proceeds to the
consideration of business other than that for which the rule
was suspended. Upon one day's notice of the proposed rule
change having been given, the senate resolution adopting
such rule change shall not be assigned to a committee
without consent of the sponsoring senator and shall be in
order to be considered by the senate at any day or time
thereafter upon motion of the sponsor during the order of
business of Resolutions.
Rule 99. No senator shall be permitted to interrupt a
roll call and no senator shall be allowed to change his or
her vote after a verification is requested by any senator,
or after the final vote is announced. When verification is
requested, any senator within the chamber who has not voted
shall vote prior to the verification of the roll.
Rule 100. A roll call vote of the senate shall be
taken upon any question at the request of five senators.
Rule 101. All senate committees shall meet on call of
the chairman and the regular meetings of the committees
shall be held at the times and places designated by the
Committee on Administration.
Rule 102. Public introduction of guests shall not be
allowed in the Senate Chamber during the last ten calendar
days of the session.".

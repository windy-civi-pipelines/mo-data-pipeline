SENATE REMONSTRANCE NO. 1
Whereas, congressional redistricting is governed by
Article III, Section 45 of the Missouri Constitution, which
states: "When the number of representatives to which the
state is entitled in the House of the Congress of the United
States under the census of 1950 and each census thereafter
is certified to the governor, the general assembly shall by
law divide the state into districts corresponding with the
number of representatives to which it is entitled..."; and
Whereas, Article III, Section 45 has existed,
unaltered, since the Constitution was adopted in 1945; and
Whereas, the plain language of Article III, Section 45
mandates that the General Assembly draw new congressional
districts every ten years, when the census is certified to
the Governor; and
Whereas, under the plain language of Article III,
Section 45, congressional redistricting may only occur in
the period immediately following the certification of the
census to the governor and may not occur again until the
next census is completed and certified; and
Whereas, in Pearson v. Koster, the Missouri Supreme
Court directly addressed the timing aspect of congressional
redistricting, stating: "Article III, Section 45...was
triggered when the results of the 2010 United States Census
revealed that...Missouri would lose one member of its
delegation... It is the responsibility of the Missouri
General Assembly to draw new congressional election
districts. The new districts will take effect for the 2012
election and remain in place for the next decade or until a
Census shows that the districts should change"; and
1

Whereas, the above analysis necessarily flows from the
plain language of Article III, Section 45. Specifically,
the General Assembly is only authorized to draw new
congressional districts when the census is certified to the
governor, which only occurs once every ten years; and
Whereas, the temporal limitation in Article III,
Section 45 prohibits the General Assembly from enacting more
than one map after the census data is released, but before
new data is released; and
Whereas, proponents of purely politically motivated mid-
cycle redistricting argue that the lack of express language
prohibiting mid-cycle redistricting means the General
Assembly may redistrict whenever it sees fit; and
Whereas, if the authors of the 1945 Constitution had
wanted to grant the General Assembly authority to redraw
congressional lines "from time to time", they would have
included such authority. Instead the language they used is
clear that congressional redistricting may only occur when
new census data is available; and
Whereas, Article III, Section 45 specifies when
congressional redistricting may take place; and
Whereas, to hold otherwise would grant the General
Assembly plenary power to engage in the legislative act of
redistricting whenever it pleased. The only possible
purpose of inserting this timing component is to establish
that it is the sole time when such power may be exercised,
meaning the timing for the General Assembly to draw
congressional districts is limited; and
Whereas, other states have interpreted provisions
similar to Article III, Section 45 of the Missouri
Constitution to prohibit mid-cycle redistricting; and
2

Whereas, in 2003, the Supreme Court of Colorado held
that its similarly worded constitutional provisions did not
permit mid-cycle congressional redistricting; and
Whereas, like Article III, Section 45 of the Missouri
Constitution, the Colorado Constitution states that the
legislature shall redistrict when "a new apportionment shall
be made by Congress" and the court ruled that there is no
language empowering the General Assembly to redistrict more
frequently or at any other time; and
Whereas, the plain language of the Missouri
Constitution and the Missouri Supreme Court's precedent make
clear that mid-cycle congressional redistricting is
prohibited; and
Whereas, any attempt at mid-cycle congressional
redistricting will draw substantial legal challenges which
will succeed and invalidate this ill-conceived, politically
motivated attempt to re-draw Congressional maps:
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved that the members of the
Missouri Senate, One Hundred and Third General Assembly,
Second Extraordinary Session, hereby remonstrate against the
Governor for calling an extraordinary session of the General
Assembly for an expressly unconstitutional purpose; and
Be It Further Resolved that the Secretary of the Senate
be instructed to send a copy of this remonstrance to the
Governor and the Missouri Supreme Court.
